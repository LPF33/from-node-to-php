            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
            <p>
                In 2019 I've jumped in at the deep end. I wanted to change my
                career and above all I was searching for something, that I do
                with passion. The bootcamp offered me a perfect way to learn so
                fast so many skills. It was worth the money! I finished this
                Bootcamp in May 2020, afterwards I deepened my skills and I'm
                really happy about this career and life change.

                The beauty of web development is that there are always new
                "brainteasers" to solve and new challenges to overcomes, and that
                is exactly the decisive factor that inspires me every day.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ever since I began coding, it became clear to me that I see my
                future in software development. In my role as a Teaching
                Assistant, I had to get into code very quickly, had to present
                solutions to participants for their problems, as well as quickly
                find the root cause of errors. In the spirit of pair
                programming, I enjoy working in a team as well as verbalizing
                code/techniques. The "you never stop learning" mentality, the
                search for solutions, the constant learning and the enormous
                diversity is what I love about computer sciences.
