            <h2>How my journey began?</h2>
            <p>
                In 2019 I've jumped in at the deep end. I wanted to change my
                career and above all I was searching for something, that I do
                with passion.
                <br />I luckily found it! <br />
                In short: Web Development, that's it! To deepen my knowledge and
                to get experienced, supportive help,
                <br />I've registered for a 3-month Bootcamp with
                <a href="https://www.spiced-acadh2y.com/" target="_blank">
                    Spiced Academy
                </a>
                .<br />
                There is no other possiblity out there expect for autodidaction
                to learn so fast so many skills. Great experience! I finished
                this Bootcamp in May 2020, afterwards I deepened my skills and
                I'm really happy about this career and life change.
